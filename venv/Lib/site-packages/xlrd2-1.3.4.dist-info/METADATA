### xlrd2

xlrd2 is an effort to extend [xlrd project](https://github.com/python-excel/xlrd), which is no longer mintained by its developers.
The main goal is to make it suitable for extracting necessary information from malicious xls documents.

**Xlrd Purpose**: Provide a library for developers to use to extract data from Microsoft Excel (tm) spreadsheet files. It is not an end-user tool.

**Versions of Python supported**: 2.7, 3.4+.

**Installation:**

1. Installing using pip

        pip install xlrd2

2. Installing the latest development
 
   Using pip

        pip install -U https://github.com/DissectMalware/xlrd2/archive/master.zip

   Or download the latest version
   
        wget https://github.com/DissectMalware/xlrd2/archive/master.zip

   Extract the zip file and go to the extracted directory
   
        python setup.py install --user
    

**Quick start**:

```python
import xlrd2
book = xlrd2.open_workbook("myfile.xls")
print("The number of worksheets is {0}".format(book.nsheets))
print("Worksheet name(s): {0}".format(book.sheet_names()))
sh = book.sheet_by_index(0)
print("{0} {1} {2}".format(sh.name, sh.nrows, sh.ncols))
print("Cell D30 is {0}".format(sh.cell_value(rowx=29, colx=3)))
for rx in range(sh.nrows):
    print(sh.row(rx))
```

**Another quick start**: This will show the first, second and last rows of each sheet in each file:

    python PYDIR/scripts/runxlrd2.py 3rows *blah*.xls
